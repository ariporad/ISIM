\section{Methodology}

Each day, millions of people drink at least one cup of coffee. Of those coffee drinkers, a substantial portion add some form of cream\footnote{Many different additives are commonly used in addition to or instead of cow-dairy cream. Popular alternatives include regular cow milk, almond milk, and soy milk.} to their coffee. However, cream must be refrigerated to prevent spoilage and food-borne illness, meaning that it is cold when added to the coffee and thereby acts to cool the coffee. If the coffee is to be drunk immediately, this is rarely a significant issue--immediately after brewing, the coffee is too hot to drink anyways, so cream serves to cool the coffee to a drinkable temperature. However, many coffee drinkers make coffee at home before commuting to work,\footnote{Notwithstanding the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has been hugely problematic for introductory undergraduate electrical engineering project pretexts.} and wish to drink their coffee upon arrival. This presents a conundrum for the coffee drinker, who must decide whether to add cream before departure or post-arrival. Which will ultimately result in a hotter cup of coffee at drinking time?

For this experiment, we set out to answer the above age-old question. We studied two different coffee creaming regimes, each simulating a 15 minute brew-to-drink time window:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adding cream to the coffee immediately after brewing, before the commute (n = 1).
	\item Adding cream to the coffee after arriving at work (t = 10 minutes post brew), 5 minutes before drinking the coffee (n = 1).
\end{enumerate}

For each trial, we poured the 100C coffee (represented by water: 150 mL for Regime #1 and 140 mL for Regime #2) into a paper cup and inserted a thermistor. For Regime #1, we immediately added 40 mL of 20C cream (also represented by water). For Regime #2, we added an identical 40 mL of 20C cream, but after 10 minutes. The temperature of all trials was measured for 15 minutes after pouring the coffee.

\subsection{Data Collection}

Figure ~\ref{fig:circuit} shows a diagram of the circuit used to measure the coffee's temperature. It consists of two identical voltage divider circuits, each dividing 5V of $V_{in}$ across a $\SI{1000}{\ohm}$ upper resistor and the lower thermistor. Leads for a channel of an O-Scope were connected across each thermistor, and the voltage measured can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
    V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{R_{thermistor}}{R_{upper} + R_{thermistor}}
\end{equation}

The thermistor's resistance can be calculated from the following formula, where $T$ is the temperature of the coffee in Kelvin: 

\begin{equation}
    R_{thermistor} = \SI{1000}{\ohm} \times e^{-3528 \left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T}\right)}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Temperatures}

Regime #1, where cream was added to the coffee immediately after brewing, resulted in significantly warmer temperatures at t = 15 minutes (51C vs. 46C, see Figure~\ref{fig:temperature}). From this, it can be determined that immediately creaming coffee is the thermally ideal coffee creaming regime. Additionally, the immediate-cream regime is logistically far simpler, and eliminates the possibility that a coffee drinker forgets to add cream to their coffee. The author of this paper can see no reason why anyone would ever follow Regime #2.

\subsection{Model}

Additionally, we fitted a theoretical model of thermal convection cooling to our data (see Figure~\ref{fig:model}). The model is described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    22 + (T\left(0\right) - 22)e^{-t \over tau}
\end{equation}

We found the model to be relatively accurate. We only compared the model to Regime #1 (immediate milking), as the model would not have been able to predict the addition of cream at t = 10 minutes. During the experiment, the coffee was left undisturbed to eliminate any thermal effects from mixing. We calculated a parameter value of $\tau = 1752 \text{ seconds}$.

\section{Finishing Remarks}
This experiment revealed several interesting conclusions about proper coffee creaming regimes. While the author has no doubt that this was a pedagogically useful lab, one cannot help but not that this absolutely constitutes "overthinking" one's morning coffee.\footnote{The other of this paper is from Seattle. Do you know what it takes to be ``overthinking coffee" in Seattleâ€½}
